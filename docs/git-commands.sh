- Proper error handling and user feedback

🔧 Technical improvements:
- Upgraded to Expo SDK 53 for latest compatibility
- Clean TypeScript implementation with proper types
- Zustand state management
- Modern React Native patterns
- Fixed all React Native warnings

🗑️ Removed:
- All fake/placeholder implementations from previous version
- Broken WatermelonDB complexity
- Non-functional sync engine
- Marketing fluff and empty promises

This is a complete rewrite that actually connects to Odoo and syncs real data!"
