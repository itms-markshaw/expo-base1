## üîç WebSocket Connection Analysis

### **Test Results:**
- **Endpoint**: `wss://itmsgroup.com.au/websocket` ‚úÖ (server responds)
- **Error**: `400 Bad Request` (authentication/headers issue)
- **Close Code**: `1006` (abnormal close)

### **What This Means:**
1. ‚úÖ **Odoo server supports WebSocket** (endpoint exists)
2. ‚úÖ **Network connectivity works** (server responds)
3. ‚ùå **Authentication required** (400 = bad request format)

### **The Issue:**
WebSocket connections from browser work because they include:
- **Session cookies** from browser authentication
- **CSRF tokens** from web session
- **Proper headers** that browsers automatically send

### **Solution for Mobile App:**
Since XML-RPC doesn't provide web session cookies, we have two options:

#### **Option 1: Use Polling Only (Recommended)**
- Disable WebSocket temporarily
- Use the robust polling system we built
- This will work reliably with XML-RPC authentication

#### **Option 2: Custom WebSocket Authentication**
- Investigate Odoo's WebSocket authentication
- Might require custom Odoo module
- More complex but provides real-time updates

### **Quick Fix: Disable WebSocket, Use Polling**

The polling system we built is actually very efficient:
- Checks for new messages every 1 second
- Only fetches messages newer than last known message
- Provides near real-time experience
- Works perfectly with XML-RPC

### **Recommendation:**
For now, **disable WebSocket and rely on polling**. This will give you:
- ‚úÖ Working chat immediately
- ‚úÖ Reliable message delivery  
- ‚úÖ Near real-time updates (1-second delay)
- ‚úÖ No authentication complexity

Later, if you need true real-time (sub-second) updates, we can investigate custom WebSocket authentication for Odoo.

### **Implementation:**
Just comment out WebSocket initialization in chat service and keep the polling system active.
